	<h4><a href="yankui/01/">YANBARUKUINA!</a><br /><small>(SEEKING ARTIST FOR COLLAB!)</small></h4>
	<p>A semi-autobiographical retelling of several episodes that happened to me when I lived in Japan as a foreigner. The first three shorts which are taken from an 
	abbreviated trip I made to Shikoku to visit a friend as a primer to my study abroad two years later, would either be standalone or a &quot;prequel&quot; to a larger 
	series. If expanded this series would tell the over-arcing story of how I met and won the heart of my wife during my time studying at a Japanese university which 
	just happens to be filled with loads of real and embellished melodrama. </p>
	<p>Click on the above link to read the script for the first short.</p>
