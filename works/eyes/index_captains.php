		This was one of the earliest videos I worked on. The equipment was non-ideal and the lighting non-existent but I still like the way it turned out thanks in no small part to the overwhelming charm of The Captains. I originally conceived this as added web content for purple sky's website in what was meant to be a series but unfortunately persistent sound issues prevented this from happening at the time. The idea of doing a pseudo dating show with Francis was mine and I'm just so pleased that The Captains rolled with it. </p>
