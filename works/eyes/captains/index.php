		This was one of the earliest videos I worked on. The equipment was non-ideal and the lighting non-existent but I still like the way it turned out thanks in no small part to the overwhelming charm of The Captains. I originally conceived this as added web content for purple sky's website in what was meant to be a series but unfortunately persistent sound issues prevented this from happening at the time. The idea of doing a pseudo dating show with Francis was mine and I'm just so pleased that The Captains rolled with it.</p>

		My first non-classroom related &quot;adventure&quot; with Brian. I'll agree with the non ideal equipment, but I couldn't offer a better suggestion, plus they (the camera &amp; mic) were free for us to use. This was also my first time in Brooklyn, as well as my introduction to &quot;Group Sounds,&quot; the ever dashing Eric Bresler, and ultimately, the Captains. It's unfortunate that we couldn't figure out the cause of audio problems, but I've filed it under the &quot;Maybe when I've got some free time I'll re-edit that on a normal editing system&quot; folder in my brain, so in 10 years or so we'll have a more functional interview with the Captains.</p>
