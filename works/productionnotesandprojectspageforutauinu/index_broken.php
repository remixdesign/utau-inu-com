		<p><strong>Zack Wozniak - MC</strong><br />
	</p>
	<p>This is one of those songs that just comes out of nowhere.  After laying down the piano and guitar the lyrics just seemed to grow from the drums.<br>
		I heard Brian's singing voice and knew it would give balance to my morbid lyrics.  <br>
		He provided a soft finish on some rough edges. (<em>boo' note: So gay!</em>)</p>

		<p><strong>boo - Hook Ho</strong><br />
	</p>
	<p> 
		There's so much anger in this song, at times I worried that its darkness was too much but the softness and decay of the hook evens things out nicely. For the life of me I couldn't remember the ten words I was supposed to sing and I fucked up continually.</p>
