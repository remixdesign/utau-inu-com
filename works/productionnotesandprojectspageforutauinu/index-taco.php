		<p>Recorded in one day in a studio/practice space in Union City, NJ. This pop punk song was written in lieu of a best man's speech for the wedding of Donald and Ying Monson. The drums are digital.</p>

		At one time this song was called "chocolate" and was a power ballad. Then I spent three straight days listening to Avril Lavigne's Best Damn Thing CD and it was reborn as a pop punk anthem. This song really came together when I was watching TV and they were talking about the history of pico de gallo. I just loved the nonsense of its meaning. Love is a frequency that needs to pick up chattering and nonsense from time to time.    </p>
