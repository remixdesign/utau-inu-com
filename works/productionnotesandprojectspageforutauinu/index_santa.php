		<p>This was the first fully recorded and released Yochien Ronin song. It was written in December of 2007 and performed for the 2007 <a href="http://www.jrockchoiceawards.com">Jrock Choice Awards</a> which was broadcast on the Tainted Reality Radio Network on January, 18th 2008.  </p>

		When Roger approached me about performing for the Jrock Choice Awards, my first instinct was to do a cover of a Jrock song. I brought Ying several songs including the Back Horn's "Hane ~Yozora wo Koete" but he rejected everything. One day I was humming a few bars of what would become the prechorus and I came up with this silly phrase "Konya no Menu ha Tonakainiku (Tonight's Menu is reindeer meat)" When I first brought it to Ying I had only that prechorus and some of the verses. My initial idea for the song was much swingier with a swagger like Sophia's Matsuoka but Ying pushed it in a darker direction which better suited the lyrics I wrote which examine the impossible standards of behavior set by the holidays. It's an anti-Christmas song to liven up your anti-Christmas parties. There's a whole lotta doofiness hidden in the zombie chorus of Na Na Nas. </p>
