	<h1>Current Projects</h1>
	
	<h4><a href="http://www.myspace.com/yoroyoro" target="_blank">Yochien Ronin</a></h4>
	<p>This is a musical project between virtuoso musician Ying Chee and myself. We make anything goes rock with a jrock/pop twist. We're currently looking for members to form a full-on band, so if you're interested contact us through our MySpace. </p>
	
	<h4>F is for Film (In Production -Coming Soon!)</h4>
	<p>At the end of the internet, we have the final word. Creators Brian Stewart and Zack Wozniak's cracked take on the movie discussion show, featuring low budget, high comedy skits goofing on movies both current and past. If you've ever wanted to bitch slap the blogosphere, we will be your surrogate. </p>
	
	<h4>YANBARUKUINA! (SEEKING ARTIST FOR COLLAB!)</h4>
	<p>A semi-autobiographical retelling of several episodes that happened to me when I lived in Japan as a foreigner. The first three shorts which are taken from an abbreviated trip I made to Shikoku to visit a friend as a primer to my study abroad two years later, would either be standalone or a &quot;prequel&quot; to a larger series. If expanded this series would tell the over-arcing story of how I met and won the heart of my wife during my time studying at a Japanese university which just happens to be filled with loads of real and embellished melodrama. </p>
	<p>Click on the above link to read the script for the first short. </p>
	<h4>I HEART ZOMBIES (WORKING TITLE *IN DEVELOPMENT)</h4>
	<p>A serial novel about a zombie obsessed girl who is convinced that the zombie apocalypse will go down on her 17th birthday. Starts here on 12/01/08.</p>
	<h4><a href="http://www.zazzle.com/utauinu" target="_blank">T-Shirts by Takako</a></h4>
	<p>My wife and I are collaborating on a number of cute/weird T-shirt designs. All of which are available through our store at zazzle.com.</p>
