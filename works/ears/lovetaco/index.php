		<p>Recorded in one day in a studio/practice space in Union City, NJ. This pop punk song was written in lieu of a best man's speech for the wedding of Donald and Ying Monson. The drums are digital.</p>

		<p><strong>boo</strong><br /> 
		At one time this song was called "chocolate" and was a power ballad. Then I spent three straight days listening to Avril Lavigne's Best Damn Thing CD and it was reborn as a pop punk anthem. This song really came together when I was watching TV and they were talking about the history of pico de gallo. I just loved the nonsense of its meaning. Love is a frequency that needs to pick up chattering and nonsense from time to time.    </p>

	<h3>Lyrics</h3>
	
	<div class="works_text">
<p>I like clouds<br /> 
I like kittens<br /> 
I don't like to clean the kitchen<br /> 
fluffy things are neat (yeah)<br /> 
unless they're growing on the meat.</p>

<p>I like Sunday<br /> 
I like breezes<br /> 
beaches without bad teenagers<br /> 
everything is right<br /> 
let's nest here for a life</p>

<p>and I said<br /> 
you're all the good shit I need<br /> 
wrapped up in one<br /> 
wrapped up in one</p>

<p>LOVETACO<br /> 
LOVETACO<br /> 
every little thing that you do drives me loco<br /> 
LOVETACO<br /> 
LOVETACO<br /> 
from now on I only wanna order from your menu<br /> 
LOVETACO<br /> 
LOVETACO<br /> 
I never get enough of your pico-de-gallo<br /> 
LOVETACO<br /> 
LOVETACO<br /> 
ooo... that means rooster's beak.</p>

<p>I like ogres
I like wizards
can't we all just play together
one ring to rule them all
it's in your coffee mug at my house</p>

<p>I like numbers
I like reason
logic puzzles for all seasons
help me stack the blocks
for a lego constructed heart</p>

<p>and I said
you're all the good shit I need
wrapped up in one
wrapped up in one</p>

<p>*chorus</p>

<p>(freespeaking)</p>

<p>and oh I can't speak. 
you're too spicy.</p>

<p>but just right for me!</p>
