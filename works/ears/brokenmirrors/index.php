After laying down the piano and guitar the lyrics just seemed to grow from the drums.<br>		I heard Brian's singing voice and knew it would give balance to my morbid lyrics.  <br>		He provided a soft finish on some rough edges.

For the life of me I 	couldn't remember the ten words I was supposed to sing and I fucked up continually.</p>	<br class="clear" /></div>	<?phpob_end_flush(); include ("../../../includes/footerL3.php");?>
