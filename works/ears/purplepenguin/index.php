		<p>This song was written for <a href="http://www.purpleskymagazine.com">purple SKY magazine</a> promotional appearances. The only actual airing of the song was on a guest appearance we made on Roger Shackleford's <a href="http://www.taintedreality.net">Tainted Reality</a> radio program. </p>

		The concept for this song actually comes from a half-aborted marketing idea we had to associate purple SKY magazine with a purple penguin character drawn by my wife Takako. Our first run of press kits actually contained an iron on of this character, but attempts to turn it into a more expressive T-shirt proved daunting. The song is mostly non-sense, about how we put our dreams on the backs of penguins in hopes they would fly off into the purple sky. Perhaps we should have put our dreams on the backs of eagles, but that wouldn't be as sad, nor as poignant. </p>
