<hr />


<p>So, you want to know more about me?</p>

<p>Well, a man is only as great as his dreams are boundless.</p>

<p>Looking back, I think I was capable of magic when I was a child. My great Aunt Dodie used to marvel at the way I could leap out of my shoes without stooping down to untie 
them. I'd tell you how I did it, but that's between me and the space time continuum.</p>

<p>My parents used to tell me that I was an alien baby. Probably in jest. Who knows?</p>

<p>Ever since I was a little boy, I've told my family that I was put on the Earth to fulfill "a great destiny." It sounded like the right thing to say at the time. I've 
certainly had my share of great experiences in my thirty years here.</p>

<h2>PROFESSIONAL LIFE</h2>

<h3>Television, Film &amp; Radio</h3>
<p>Currently I'm seeking interesting opportunities in the entertainment field, specifically, television and film. I'm working for Local Programming with Cablevision New Jersey and am in the process of writing a series for eventual production. Ultimately I'd love to take one of my own ideas from infancy to fully-grown product and be involved in the writing/casting/directing/performing and editing of it. </p>
<p>I have a home studio capable of producing professional quality videos, if anyone is interested please contact me and we'll work something out. </p>
<p>Until December of 2007 I produced and performed a weekly pre-recorded radio show called &quot;WILD ZERO RADIO&quot; for Roger Shackleford's Tainted Reality Radio Network. The format  was Japanese rock with 20% talk.</p>
<p>I've also done some voice over work for Tainted Reality.</p>

<h3>Magazine Editor</h3>

<p>Up until February of 2008 I worked as the Editorial Director for <em>purple SKY</em>, a Japanese rock magazine, the only one in fact, in English. As ED I decided on what artists to cover, set-up the interviews for my fellow writers or myself, coordinated with our staff and managed the submission of writing and art, which included translating any Japanese material. Though it gave me a chance to meet many amazing artists and people, all in all, it was a time consuming soul-crushing process that offered very little &quot;off&quot; time between issues. It was a labor of love. As of February 2008, 7 issues have been produced and sold nationally through Barnes and Nobles, Borders, Hot Topic and more. You can see more information on the magazine under the Projects section of utau-inu.</p>

<h3>Singer/songwriter</h3>
<p>Risking becoming a Jack-of-all-Trade and master of none, I'm also a singer and songwriter. When I was in Japan I was in several bands, none of which lasted for the long haul. Since then I've been working off and on with my friend Ying on several unfinished projects. I hope to be able to share them with the readers of utau-inu.com in the near future. </p>
<h3>Translator/writer</h3>
<p>Aside from writing at minimum two features per issue for <em>purple SKY</em>, I'm also known across the web for the translations of Japanese songs I did with my wife Takako, from 1998 to 
2007 for the now defunct website www.centigrade-j.com. Our translations have been called some of the best available on the net, and our body of work totaled more than 4,000 songs 
at the point we shut down the website. Some of these can be viewed in the Works section.</p>
<h3>Artist</h3>
<p>I'm not an artist. If you like anything I've drawn, painted or photographed here, it's only because we share an equally eschewed worldview.</p>

<h2>PRIVATE LIFE FAQ</h2>

<h6>Who is this boo fellow?</h6>

<p>"boo" is my alter ego. It was truncated from a much longer nickname given to me when I was attending Clark University where I graduated with a Bachelor of the Arts in Japanese. I 
do not have multiple personalities but I believe when I channel "the boo" I am able to tap into some usually dormant part of my brain that lacks inhibitors. I was a published poet 
under this penname years ago and it just sort of stuck around.</p>

<h6>Do you have any hobbies?</h6>

<p>It feels like most of my hobbies are somehow related to my career goals, making music, or videos. Writing stories and poetry. Outside of that, just the normal "boy" stuff video games, 
comic books, movies.</p>

<h6>Name one video game, one comic and one movie that sum you up:</h6>

<p>Video Game: Earthworm Jim<br />
Comic: Futatsu no Supika<br />
Movie: I HEART HUCKABEES</p>

<h6>I've heard you speak Japanese, what was your secret?</h6>

<p>Spirit. What the Japanese call "kotodama." Before one can truly connect with a language one needs to understand the spirit in the words. All words have a pulse. You have to find it 
and set yours to match. This comes with time, living or working with native speakers. Listening to music and singing is a great way to develop this too. A less tree-huggy way to 
say this would be to speak and know from firsthand experience or knowledge the meaning behind what you are saying and why you are saying it in that specific way.</p>

<h6>Why do you like Japan so much, the U.S. of A not good enough for ya?</h6>

<p>No. And it shouldn't be good enough for anyone. It's not that I think anywhere is better necessarily, but there's certainly more out there to see. I just happened to fall in love with 
Japan. I'm not crazy about the food though.</p>

<h6>Hey baby what's your sign?</h6>

<p>See the ring on the finger? Yup, married.</p>

<h6>Come on, just one drink?</h6>

<p>Sorry, me and my wife Takako are soulmates. We're making the world a better place just by being together. I couldn't jeopardize that, the future hangs in the balance.</p>

<h6>Tell us about the moment when your childhood ended.</h6>

<p>When my dog died I tried to sell my soul to the devil for more time with her. Problem was I never truly believed myself. That loss of faith in the magical signaled the end for my 
childhood. I was a pre-teen when it happened.</p>

<h6>And when did you realize you were an adult?</h6>

<p>When I tore my rotator cuff lifting a shopping basket and mimicking yoga later that day.</p>

<h6>Your father is American and your mother is Vietnamese. What was it like growing up in a culturally diverse household?</h6>

<p>Well first of all both of my parents are of mixed ethnicity. My mother is only half Vietnamese, the rest is a mix of French and Chinese. My father too, may be from two American born 
parents but our family background is a blend of Scottish and German among others.</p>

<p>As for the question, it was what it was. My mother didn't speak her native tongue around us so I never learned it. Having a mother whose first language wasn't English did teach me that 
communication is about the heart more than the head.</p>

<h6>Who is your personal hero?</h6>

<p>That would be Steve Purcell the creator of Sam &amp; Max. Or, if we're speaking of fictional characters, maybe Indiana Jones. I also really dig what Fiona Apple represents from the 
music to the watching of Columbo.</p>

<h6>What's wrong with the world today?</h6>

<p>We have less fancy hats and less impressive beards than our predecessors</p>

<h6>What's your secret talent?</h6>

<p>I can scream like a B-movie scream queen. Or Ned from The Simpsons. Or that dude with the frizzy hair in American Movie.</p>

<h6>Do you believe in God?</h6>

<p>Sure. Is he buying?</p>

<h6>Will you send me one of your awesome holiday cards this year?</h6>	
	
<p>No, but I will post scans for you all to enjoy. I actually skipped last year so I'm way behind.</p>

<h6>Can I put your work on my website?</h6>

<p>If you write me and ask permission we might be able to work something out.</p>

<h6>Can I join your fanclub?</h6>

<p>Only if you can find it.</p>
